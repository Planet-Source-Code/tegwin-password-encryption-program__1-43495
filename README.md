## Password encryption program


</div>

### Description

Not another login program.. :-)

This is a complete, FULL FUNCTIONAL login program. I did not write the code for the login

procedure or the encryption algorithm, so credit to whoever did. I just took, 2 programs and and changed some of it and then put them together to get a login program with ENCRYPTION.

Heres how it works. When you login with the default of admin/admin, it will bring you to the User Maintenance screen where you will be able to add/remove edit users etc. When you add/edit a user, it will encrypt their password and write it into the DB. You can select if you want the user to be an admin or normal user, a Normal user does not get the user maintence screen.

One other thing you will notice, is that you cannot delete the admin account from the interface, you can delete it from Access though :-(, aslo you cannot change it from being an administrator, this is for security reasons. You can however change the password. If you would like to see what the passwords are stored like, in the database then open access and look inside. If anyone has any idea how I can prevent admin being deleted from Access any help would be appreciated.

One other thing you will notice, is that when you first run the program, it will display a disclaimer screen, which will allow you decide whether you want it to display it again in the future, if you click the button then it will no longer display writes the value into an ini file

the password for the database is passw0rd
